# Patscal

I'm making a Pascal! Mostly inspired by Apple Pascal circa 1980, which was an implementation of UCSD Pascal for Apple II computers.

## Status

It's not done yet. So far I just have a bunch of examples cribbed from the reference manual.

## Plans

- Written in TypeScript with [Ohm](https://ohmjs.org).
- Compiled to WebAssembly.
- ???
